# Linux Kernel Configuration Project

## Motivation

This project originated from my desire to learn the process of configuring, 
compiling, and installing a Linux kernel. In pursuit of this goal, I aim to 
achieve the following objectives:

1. Enhance system performance.
2. Optimize resource utilization.
3. Eliminate the use of initramfs (resulting in no kernel modules).
4. Experiment with the new Intel Xe driver.

## Notes

Detailed documentation, including step-by-step instructions and valuable tips, 
is available in the NOTES.md file. Much of the knowledge shared in this 
documentation is credited to the book "Linux Kernel in a Nutshell" by Greg 
Kroah-Hartman, which has been instrumental in guiding me through various aspects 
of this project.

## My System

To gain insights into my system configuration and identify relevant drivers for 
inclusion/exclusion, I regularly consult the output of commands such as lshw and 
lsmod. While this may not be considered a best practice, as highlighted in 
NOTES.md/Finding Drivers, it provides a general understanding of the system and 
aids in making informed decisions during the configuration process.

Feel free to explore the NOTES.md file for comprehensive information and 
additional tips gathered throughout this project.
