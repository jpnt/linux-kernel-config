# Linux Kernel Configuration

## Motivation

This project originated from my desire to learn the process of configuring, 
compiling, and installing a Linux kernel. In pursuit of this goal, I aim to 
achieve the following:

1. Documentation of Linux compilation and installation, from start to finish.
2. Enhance system performance and resource utilization.
3. Experiment the new Intel Xe driver.
4. Eliminate the use of initramfs (resulting in no kernel modules).

## Notes

Documentation, step-by-step instructions and valuable tips, 
are available in the ![NOTES.md](./NOTES.md) file. Much of the knowledge shared
in this documentation is credited to the book "Linux Kernel in a Nutshell" by 
Greg Kroah-Hartman.

## My System

To gain insights into system configuration and identify relevant drivers for 
inclusion/exclusion, I consult the output of various utilities available at
![system](./system/).
